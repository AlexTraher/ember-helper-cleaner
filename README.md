# ember-helper-cleaner
Traverses an ember app and finds any unused helpers

# Installation 

`npm install -g ember-helper-cleaner`

# Usage

1. `cd` to your Ember app
2. run `ember-helper-cleaner`

# The Future
We may get round to adding functionality to automatically delete unused helpers and their tests from the app.
